    <h1>String Implementation</h1>

<p>Strings in Opal are immutable which means that their contents cannot
change once created. This means that various string methods like
<code>strip!</code> will not work, and an error will be thrown when called. Their
immutable counterpart methods are still available which typically return
a new string.</p>

<h2>Implementation details</h2>

<p>Ruby strings are toll-free bridged to native javascript strings, meaning
that anywhere that a ruby stirng is required, a normal javascript string
may be passed. This dramatically improces the performance of opal due to
a lower overhead in the allocation of strings.</p>

<p>The immutability of javascript strings is directly the reason why
strings in opal are immutable.</p>
