<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Opal is a ruby runtime and standard library designed to run
directly on top of javascript. It can be run within the browser or on
the command line through the bundled build tools. Opal includes a
parser/compiler, written in ruby, that builds ruby ahead of time
directly into javascript that can run alongside the bundled
runtime.</p>

    <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="no">RQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ready?</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="no">RQuery</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;a&#39;</span><span class="o">].</span><span class="n">click</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">alert</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Thanks for visiting....&quot;</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Ruby parser in your browser</h3>
<p>Opal's ruby parser/compiler is itself written in ruby, and can
self compile into javascript allowing ruby to be parsed and
evaluated directly in the browser without the need for plugins.</p>
<p>If you include the parser in your page it will look for all
script tags in your page that are "text/ruby" and will evaluate them
in order. This allows for quick experimentation with the opal
runtime and removes the need for constant recompilation of source
files during development.</p>

<h3>Clean generated code</h3>
<p>The code generator in opal takes care ensuring that the generated
javascript is clean which helps in debugging the code using existing
tools (such as those built into browsers). More than this, whenever
possible, the generated code will keep local variables, method
arguments and block arguments the same as the original ruby code so
that they keep a meaningful name during debugging processes.<p>
<p>More importantly, opal generates code that maintains the correct
line number so that going through stack traces and following code
paths is as simple as referring back to original ruby sources
instead of mentally mapping between the generated javascript and
pure ruby sources.</p>
<p>Combining these two features makes the following ruby code
cleanly compile to the repective javascript:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">some_method</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">first_arg</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">second_arg</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">first_arg</span>
  <span class="n">second_arg</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">some_method</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">200</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Compiled javascript:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="nx">$def</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;some_method&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">first_arg</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">second_arg</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">self</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">m$puts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">first_arg</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">second_arg</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">});</span>

<span class="nx">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">m$some_method</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="mi">200</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Toll free bridging to native objects</h3>
<p>To really increase performance, opal bridges some of the core
ruby objects onto native javascript objects. For example, a ruby
string is simply a javascript string and a ruby array is just a
javascript array. Using these native objects and their functions as
much as possible helps opal to be as fast as possible.</p>

<p>The currently bridged classes are String, Array, Proc, Numeric
and Exception. One limitation of the toll free bridging is that
classes such as Numeric are used to represent both Fixnum and Float,
which means that seperate Number classes are not currently possible.
The compiler has support for generating wrapped numerics which
allows for true ruby numbers, but the performance hit of wrapping
every sigle number is too great. Performance is chosen over features
in this instance.</p>

<h3>Inline javascript</h3>
<p>As opal targets the javascript platform, the functionality of
backticks in opal is altered to allow inline javascript directly in
ruby sources. This makes integration with existing javascript
libraries extremely easy. This approach also means that opal is
still syntactically correct ruby and will therefore still pass
through all third party ruby parsers and libraries (for example to
document code using YARD etc).

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">msg</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="sb">`alert(msg);`</span>
  <span class="kp">nil</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">title</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sb">`document.title`</span>
<span class="n">alert</span> <span class="s2">&quot;document title is: </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">title</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Javascript runtime</h3>
<p>Opal's runtime is written in javascript, and takes advantage
of key javascript language features (when possible) to deliver
a fast runtime to support the ruby libraries.</p>

browser (no plugins!). <a href="javascript:opal.browser_repl();">Run
